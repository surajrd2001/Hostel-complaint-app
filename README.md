# Hostel Gravience Tracker App

“Hostel Management Complaint Redressal App” is a native (android & iOS) Application
developed for managing various complaints that occured in the hostel. For the past few years,
the number of educational institutions is increasing rapidly. Thereby the number of hostels is 
also increasing for the accommodation of the students studying in this institution. And hence 
there is a lot of strain on the person who is running the hostel and software’s not usually used 
in this context. This particular project deals with the problems of managing complaints and 
avoids the problems which occur when carried out manually. Identification of the drawbacks 
of the existing system leads to the designing of a computerized system that will be compatible 
with the existing system with the system which is more user-friendly and more GUI-oriented. 
We can improve the efficiency of the system, thus overcome the drawbacks of the existing 
system. So it will help students as well as the person who handles the complaints. Here the 
paperwork is reduced which leads to saving money as well.
